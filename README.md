# RGB-D-SLAM

This built-from-scratch project aims at constructing a simple RGB-D SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) solution. This project is generally modified and completed from a simple function to a relatively sophisticated RGB-D SLAM solution.

The basic elements of this project can be summarized as:
1. Feature Extraction
2. Visual Odometry Construction
3. Graph Optimization
4. Loop Detecture

Prerequisites
---
OpenCV2, Eigen, PCL, g2o
