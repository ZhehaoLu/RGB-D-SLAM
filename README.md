# RGB-D-SLAM

These are a series of projects built from scratch, aiming at constructing a simple RGB-D SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) solution. This project is generally modified and completed from a simple function (of detecting matchable features from two consecutive frames from part_1) to a relatively sophisticated solution.

The basic elements of this project can be summarized as:
1. Feature Extraction
2. Visual Odometry Construction
3. Graph Optimization
4. Loop Detecture
